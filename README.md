# APIBAN

APIBAN helps prevent unwanted SIP traffic by identifying addresses of known bad actors before they attack your system. Bad actors are collected through globally deployed honeypots and curated by [APIBAN](https://apiban.org).

**NOTE:** If you are looking to protect your PBX or SIP server without programming, you should use the [**APIBAN** client](https://github.com/apiban/apiban-client-go) to automatically block traffic. **This is the easiest and quickest way to implement APIBAN data and block traffic.**
